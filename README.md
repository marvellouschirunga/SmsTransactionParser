# Overview

The purpose of this software is to parse transaction details from SMS messages, categorize them, and generate reports. This project demonstrates my ability to work with Kotlin's syntax and features, such as data classes, enums, and regular expressions.

The primary goal of this software is to automate the extraction and organization of transaction data from SMS messages, which can be useful for personal finance management or integration with other financial systems.

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ IDEA, a powerful and user-friendly integrated development environment (IDE) for Kotlin and Java development. The programming language used is Kotlin, which is known for its concise syntax and interoperability with Java. Additionally, I utilized the kotlinx.serialization library for JSON handling, although it is currently not implemented in the final version.

# Future Work

There are several areas for improvement and additional features that can be added to this project:

- Enhance the SMS parsing logic to handle a wider variety of transaction formats.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction with the software.
- Implement more robust error handling and validation for SMS input.
- Integrate with external APIs for real-time transaction categorization and analysis.
